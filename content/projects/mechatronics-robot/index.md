The [final competition](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/12/students-best-corporate-sponsor-robot-contest) of my Mechatronics class had a simple goal: bring all the wooden cubes to our side of the board.

My team of three—Set Enable Interrupt—created a bright pink robot plastered with memes. Dubbed Kirbotty McFinioFace after professors Brian Kirby and Ben Finio, the robot featured a pair of sweeping arms and a suite of sensors to navigate the board. Despite the shenanigans, our neat breadboards and reliable mechanism brought us just shy of first place.
