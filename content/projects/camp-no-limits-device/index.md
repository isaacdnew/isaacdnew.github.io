In collaboration with [Operation Namaste](https://www.operationnamaste.org/), I collaboratively prototyped a [portable 3D printer](https://isaacdnew.com/g-tour-3d-printer) that folds into a briefcase. The work culminated in bringing the prototype to [Camp No Limits](https://nolimitsfoundation.org) at Quinnipiac University in July 2019, where I spent a long weekend working with prosthetists and a congenital amputee to design and print her a hand device for working out in the gym. Here are some pictures showing the process:

## Day 1: July 12
{{< figure src="images/Hand V0 v11.png" title="The initial CAD model. Two different-diameter notches on the distal end allow for easy, no-slip support when pushing against a bar. The mushroom shape allows for hooking around bars and pulling on them." >}}

{{< figure src="images/20190712_070519.jpg" title="The first printed version. The patient liked how the notches performed, but the mushroom shape wasn't secure enough to help her lift weights." >}}

## Day 2: July 13
{{< figure src="images/Hand V1 (1 Notch) v7.png" title="One of two second-iteration CAD models. A notch is removed to increase stiffness, and two hook features (of different diameters) are present. These provide a more secure way to pull on or lift bars." >}}

{{< figure src="images/Hand V1 (2 Notches) v9.png" title="The other second-iteration CAD model. Here, both notches remain. The hook features are the same as the single-notch concept." >}}

{{< figure src="images/20190712_175401.jpg" title="Printing the two-notch, two-hook model. Extrusion was somewhat inconsistent with the TPU filament we used." >}}

## Day 3: July 14
After the patient saw the two second-iteration concepts and tried out the print of the two-notch version, she noted that having two hooks was annoying. The mushroom shape was useful for smaller pulling tasks, but that usefulness decreased significantly when an extra clip-hook feature got in the way. She also said she would prefer a slightly stiffer feel when pulling on a bar.

{{< figure src="images/Hand V2 v4.png" title="The final concept. This version reduces the size of one notch to increase stiffness in that direction, and it only includes one clip-hook feature, leaving room to use the mushroom shape for smaller tasks." >}}

{{< figure src="images/20190711_222659.jpg" title="Printing the final concept. This specific print didn't finish before Camp No Limits ended, so it had to be scrapped." >}}

## After Camp No Limits
{{< figure src="images/20190717_160152.jpg" title="Printing the final concept, take two (using a better-tuned printer back in Lake Placid)." >}}

{{< figure src="images/20190724_165734.jpg" title="Fully printed, attached to one of the patient's sockets. Notice how the hook feature wraps almost 270°, allowing for size adjustment by bending it outward." >}}
{{< figure src="images/20190801_155822.jpg" title="Cleaned up and coated in a rubber sealant — to decrease porosity and provide a nice finish." >}}

{{< figure src="images/20190801_160508.jpg" title="Mounted for testing. It deforms nicely when you put weight on it." >}}

{{< figure src="images/20190801_160205.jpg" title="Looks like both a futuristic mushroom and a LEGO® minifigure hand — sleek and functional." >}}

After fabricating the device, we shipped it to the patient. She loved having gym hand that finally worked, not to mention its rapid development cycle and low cost.
