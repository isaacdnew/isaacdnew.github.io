When COVID-19 hit, a group of makers in the Tri-Lakes area banded together to provide much-needed face shields to local healthcare professionals. As Head R&D Engineer, I researched face shield designs, improved one given user feedback, and coordinated with the group to maximize printer throughput and uptime by providing stacked models and guidance for print settings. We distributed over 4500 face shields to hospitals, search-and-rescue teams, and essential workers throughout the Tri-Lakes area.
