When COVID-19 hit, a group of makers in the Tri-Lakes area banded together to provide much-needed face shields to local healthcare professionals. As Head R&D Engineer, I researched face shield designs, improved one given user feedback, and coordinated with the group to maximize printer throughput and uptime by providing stacked models and guidance for print settings. We distributed over 4500 face shields to hospitals, search-and-rescue teams, and essential workers throughout the Tri-Lakes area.

## Research
We started the project in March 2020 by searching for proven designs already in use. The goal was to minimize the time it took for local professionals to adopt the face shields, so we chose to minimize the amount of new designing to be done.

## Combining two designs
Prusa and ????

## Stacking models for printing
The Prusa visors were downloadable as STL models that included multiple copies of the part, stacked on top of each other for quick printing. I decided to do the same thing for my design, but I increased the number of visors in the stack to maximize the use of most printers' build volumes.

## Improving the tabs
Later in the summer, as the visors made it to more care providers, we got reports of problems with the barbed tabs of the original design. They were causing cracks around the mounting holes in the clear plastic shields, and they were also not holding the plastic securely enough. I was tasked with updating the design to solve these two problems.

I came up with a rounded, slightly oversized tab design that snapped into the holes.

## Printing lots of visors â€” and fast
