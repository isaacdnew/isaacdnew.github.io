An acoustic keyboard that sounds like polyphonic pan pipes.

## Prototype Versions

### Ice Keys P1

This was the first prototype, with 25 keys. A 3-tone color palette and exposed mechanisms give it a steampunk feel.

Main Issues:

1. **Pipe sealing.** The pipes don’t seal well enough with the blocks that hold them, so the sound is at best a whisper.
2. **Heavy key action.** The keys are hard to press.
3. **Bad ergonomics.** It’s hard to hold (since it has no handle) and hard to play (since it has stiff, narrow keys).
4. **Incorrect pipe lengths.** The model I used to determine the lengths is based on too many idealizations.
5. **Looks.** The blue color is too pale and the off-white keys look dirty.

### Ice Keys P2

The first playable version, also with 25 keys. Minimal casing and a better 2-tone PLA palette make for a sleek, versatile second prototype.

Main issues:

1. **Valve Sealing.** Some valves stopped closing after some time in storage, making some notes sound whether played or not.
2. **Tuning.** The pitch varies significantly with variations in lung pressure, so tuning requires a steadier source of air, e.g. from a bellows.
3. **Build Quality.** While its appearance and ergonomics are much better than P1, P2 still feels like a prototype. Some edges are unfinished; some mechanisms uncovered.

### Ice Keys P3

This is the most recent prototype. With its larger 30-key range, wrap-around case and compact action, it improves on P2 in many areas. This version has a 3-tone color palette, sporting a translucent royal blue and clear keys on a black body.

Main issues:

1. **Pipe sealing.** The switch to PETG filament made bubbles and tiny pores more common, which surprised me because PETG has exceptional layer adhesion. In addition, I added a 180° bend to the lower pipes. That curved roof has a large porosity as well.
   * The solution here was the obvious one: revert to PLA, which gives much better self-sealing results.
2. **Anticipated: Tuning.** This iteration will also need a steady air source for tuning.
   * Unexpectedly, this was not nearly as much of an issue for P3 as it was for P2. The new mouth design and lower overall range really helped.
3. **Valves (again).** Some valves stopped closing after some time in storage, making some notes sound whether played or not.
