## Engineering and Design
Throughout my life, I've pursued a wide range of design projects. From my early LEGOÂ® sculptures to my recent Ice Keys musical instrument to my work at Combat Robotics at Cornell, one thing has been consistent: I love to create compact, beautiful, functional designs that advance both my understanding of the world and our stewardship of it.

## Music
I write electronic pop songs and distribute them wherever music can be streamed. I post some less-polished work on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/isaacnewcomb). I'm also the keyboardist in my band, [The Fuse](https://linktr.ee/thefuse). We play rock with influences from metal, alternative, blues and other genres, and our work in 2022 and 2023 culminated in two performances at Cornell's Slope Day festival.

## In my free time...
Outside, I like skiing, hiking, rock climbing and riding my scooter. Inside, I like to play Minecraft, watch videos and shows, play Dungeons and Dragons, and build things. I also mess around with sound design, so if my speakers are on you'll hear some funky synths.
