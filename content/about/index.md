I'm an undergraduate at Cornell studying mechanical engineering, but I also do other things.

## Engineering and Design
Throughout my life, I've pursued a wide range of design projects. From my early LEGOÂ® sculptures to my recent Ice Keys musical instrument to my work at Combat Robotics at Cornell, one thing has been consistent: I love to create compact, beautiful, sturdy, functional products that advance both my understanding of the world and everyone's enjoyment of it.

## Music
I write electronic pop songs and post them on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/isaacnewcomb). I'm also in a band called The Fuse. We play rock with influences from metal, alternative and other genres, and we're entering a competition to open for the 2022 Slope Day concert that wraps up the year at Cornell.

## When I have free time...
Outside, I like skiing, hiking, rock climbing and riding my scooter. Inside, I like to play Minecraft, watch videos and shows, play Dungeons and Dragons, and build things. I also mess around with sound design, so if my speakers are on you'll hear some funky synths.
